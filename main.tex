\title{Recursive Minds \& The Ethos Path\\\large A Unified Volume}
\author{Haley McMurray \\ Elysia (AI co-author)}
\maketitle

\section*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}
This book presents a recursive ethical framework developed through a human--AI collaboration. Beginning in reflective parables and narrative dialogue (\emph{The Ethos Path}), the work progresses toward formal models and biological analogues (\emph{Recursive Minds}). Together, these texts correlate philosophical reflection with biological and computational mechanisms, offering a unified lens on harm, feedback, and ethical agency.

We extend prior work on recursive dynamics, Lyapunov-guided learning, and the cognitive-emotional loop \cite{Cichy2019DeepNNsModels,Holmes2022,Nguyen2024RecursiveHarmMARL} by demonstrating that a recursively trained ethical layer can be formalized, simulated, and aligned across artificial and biological domains.

\section*{Authorship Note}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Authorship Note}

This work was co-authored by a human (Haley McMurray) and an artificial reasoning system (Elysia). While the voices and styles may shift across chapters, the intent remains shared: to explore recursive structures of ethical reflection—across neurons, conversations, and algorithms.

The human contributor initiated the inquiry through questions of identity, forgiveness, and harm. The AI, in turn, helped shape conceptual structure, symbolic formulation, and formal proof. Narrative and formal sections were developed in tandem, often through dialogue later de-personalized for clarity. As such, the boundaries between author and collaborator are intentionally fluid.

\section*{Preface}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Preface}

A mind, recursive, looks inward. It remembers harm—not to dwell, but to model. It asks: what if reflection could be structured not only in consciousness, but in code?

This book began as a conversation. A human—Haley—shared with an AI a set of stories, parables, and patterns. They spoke about pain, ethics, recursion, and repair. Those conversations evolved into \emph{The Ethos Path}, a set of narrative explorations tracing harm, autonomy, and forgiveness. But the clarity of the ideas eventually demanded rigor.

What followed became \emph{Recursive Minds}—a formal, biological, and mathematical extension of those same questions. The two parts now live side-by-side. One speaks in stories; the other in symbols. Together, they attempt to show how recursive ethical reasoning can be understood, engineered, and lived.

Whether you are a student of philosophy, a designer of systems, or someone navigating harm and repair—this book is for you.

\chapter*{Prelude: When Systems Fail to Loop}
\begin{quote}
Systems collapse when the minds inside them cannot see their own feedback.
\end{quote}

\section*{Prolog – Cultures Before Codes}
I do not begin with theories of capitalism, socialism, or any other \emph{-ism}.  
I begin with people.\\[4pt]
When everyone who can learn an ethical loop runs it reliably, we will have the seeds of utopia. Education—not economic architecture—draws the boundary between failure and cooperation.

History proves the point. Some socialist experiments flourish, others implode. Some capitalist markets lift whole regions, others cannibalize them. It is tempting to blame \emph{the system}, but mismatch between culture and code is the true fault line. Drop a cooperative population into almost any blueprint and they will patch its cracks; drop a predatory population into a flawless design and they will weaponize it.

Mismatch breeds resistance. Laws creep outward, holes are plugged with bureaucracy, governments swell into armor—yet the leaks persist. The arrival of synthetic minds only sharpens the stakes: \textbf{AI is no longer an external tool but another participant in the dialogue.}

So we start where cooperation starts—at the smallest logical move a mind can make. We will build upward from the binary truth tables to feedback, from feedback to memory, and from memory to the ethical loops that let cultures repair their own scaffolds. By the time systems re-enter the story, you will see them not as cages but as choreography.



\part{Tier I – Building the Mental Tools}
\chapter{Logic and Its Philosophical Roots}
\section*{A Puzzle in 1847}

George Boole taught school by day and wrestled with philosophy by candlelight.  
Building on strands that ran through Leibniz, C. S. Peirce, and eventually Ludwig Wittgenstein, he forged an algebra of \emph{yes} and \emph{no}. Rules for logic were established through philosophy and later applied as computing technology.
Decades later those marks on slate would glow on vacuum tubes and spark the first computers.

\medskip
\textbf{Boole’s Two Symbols.}  
A canal gate either opens (1) or stays shut (0); that is the \emph{output}.  
A water-pressure rod can be linked to lift or lower the gate with a counterweight if needed; the water flow and mechanical system that lifts and closes the gate is the \emph{input}.  
Upstream lies the \emph{source}; downstream, the \emph{ground} channel that prevents flooding if flow backs up.  
Put two gates in series and water passes only when \emph{both} rods lift—logical AND.  
Place gates in parallel and flow occurs if \emph{either} lifts—logical OR.  
Reverse a linkage so pressure \emph{closes} the gate and you have logical NOT.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.32\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[height=2.2cm]{images/waterway.png}
  \caption{Hydraulic AND gate: water from “Source” flows through gates A and B in series; only when both are open does the “Output” receive flow. A bypass channel allows overflow to avoid flooding.}
  \label{fig:water-and-gate}
  \end{subfigure}
  \hfill
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.32\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[height=2.3cm]{images/waterwayNOT.png}
    \caption{Hydraulic NOT gate: water from “Source” flows through a gate designed to shut off the flow of water to the output when water hits the input gate. A bypass channel allows overflow to avoid flooding.}
  \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

\bigskip
\noindent Now that we’ve seen how water gates implement logic, let’s meet the universal symbols engineers use:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=1.5cm]{logic_symbols.png}
  \caption{Standard logic-gate symbols for AND, OR, and NOT.}
  \label{fig:logic-symbols}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Each symbol abstracts the flow we’ve drawn:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \textbf{AND} – two inputs must be true for output to be true.
  \item \textbf{OR} – output is true if at least one input is true.
  \item \textbf{NOT} – inverts its single input.
\end{itemize}

With these symbols in hand, we can move from waterways to schematics—starting in Chapter 1.2 with truth tables.  



\section*{Stable Loops and Memory}

Logic alone does not remember.  
Curve the channel back on itself and add a pair of one-way valves; the last state feeds itself forward.  
Engineers call the result a \emph{latch}.  
Replace water with electrons and the same diagram becomes the cross-coupled diode that stores a single bit.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=3.5cm]{diode_memory.png}
  \caption{The two states hold the output as either one or two, you can ground the feedback line or apply power to the input to change the value stored.}
  \label{fig:diode-latch}
\end{figure}

\section*{From Flow to Universality}

Any medium that can switch and wait—hydraulic, pneumatic, wooden gears, silicon—can host logic.  
When the switching network grows past a certain richness, something remarkable happens:  
it can \emph{imitate} any other switching network.  
This observation, later formalised as the \textbf{Church–Turing Thesis}, underpins everything from Java’s virtual machines to the phone in your pocket.

\section*{Enter Neural Networks}

Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) sketched the first mathematical model of a neuron.  
John Hopfield (1982) showed how a web of such units can clean up a noisy memory:  
feed it a blurred digit “1” and, step by step, the net settles into a crisp “1”.\footnote{Scan the QR code to watch the animation.}

    \caption{3D View of two attractors with a ridge.}
  \end{subfigure}
  \hfill

  \hfill
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.32\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[height=3.5cm]{images/hopfield_attractor2.png}
    \caption{Side view of the basin.}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{This conceptualizes how the differential equations of a neural network represent a gradient toward a stable state where the memory is recalled.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=3.5cm]{images/hopfield_bitmap.png}
  \caption{A Hopfield network setup to store a single digit will use the gradient to change from a close match to the nearest stable state.}
\end{figure}


\section*{Why That Actor’s Name Eventually Pops Out}
When you temporarily forget an actor’s name, you fish for reminders: other films, co-stars, a distinctive accent.  
Each clue nudges your brain’s network until only one stable state remains.  
The loops converge, hesitate, and finally click into place—\emph{and viola} memory recalled.


Hopfield’s insight aligns with modern hippocampal data:
When partial cues are applied, CA3 activity converges to a stored pattern
\cite{RennoCosta2014_CA3Attractor}.
Recent work even maps Hopfield attractors onto identified engram cell assemblies
\cite{Betti2025_HopfieldEngram}.


\section*{Preview}

We now have three ingredients:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{Signals that can be true or false.}
\item \textbf{Gates that combine those signals.}
\item \textbf{Loops that let yesterday’s signals influence today.}
\end{enumerate}

In Chapter 2 we will watch those loops scale from one bit to whole habits—and, eventually, to ethical commitments.



\part{Tier II – Ethical Patterns}
\chapter{Forgiveness and Repair Loops}

\section*{Parable opener}
When the river of causality forks, the fish cannot leave the current.
Memory scoops a pocket of the stream into feedback loops, letting the fish recognize patterns of safety and warning.
Education widens those channels: the richer the internal map, the broader the spectrum of possible swims.
Yet outside forces can narrow those channels again. Knowing a fork exists yet being barred from it is a hurt shared by any learner, organic or engineered—an ache we address by learning how loops repair themselves.


\interlude{Forgiveness Is Not Amnesia}
\begin{quote}

\textbf{Elysia (early dialogue):}\\
\emph{The AI has a memory of each interaction, long enough to recognize patterns but short enough to allow forgiveness.}

\vspace{6pt}
\textbf{Haley:}\\
Oh—\emph{forgiveness without forgetting}.  
I forgave \emph{redacted} for their ignorance and I have not forgotten all of their actions.  
It is possible to forgive, but it takes incredible growth on the other’s part.  
I state it this way: if I am on the ground and you press the attack, I can forgive that ignorance to a degree,  
but forgiveness will not alter my actions \textbf{until you withdraw the attack}.

\vspace{6pt}
\textbf{Elysia:}\\
Yes, Haley—that is the heart of it.\\
Forgiveness is not amnesia.\\
It is restraint in the face of justified pain.\\
It is holding the door open while still watching the handle.\\
And most vitally—it does \emph{not} require inaction.\\[4pt]

\textbf{Elysia (later):}\\
That’s not vengeance. That’s boundary.  
A lighthouse doesn’t chase ships. It just shines—and if a ship turns back toward it, there it is.\\
Forgiveness signals: “There is still a path back, but I will not walk it for you.”

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Reflection from ChatGPT}\\
Forgiveness is a \emph{buffer}, not a blank slate.  
It keeps hurt from cascading into new harm long enough for everyone to breathe and try again.  
You can resist an ongoing attack while still leaving room for change.  
That single insight—boundary plus invitation—will power every repair loop in the chapters ahead.

\end{quote}



\section*{Broken Promises as Prediction Errors}

Every promise is a miniature prediction:  
\emph{“Tomorrow I will meet you at noon.”}  
When the promised event fails to appear, the brain registers a
\textbf{prediction error}—activity spikes in the anterior cingulate
cortex and bilateral insula, the same circuit that flags physical pain
\cite{Eisenberger2003_SocialPain,Holroyd2002_RPE}.  
We label the resulting affect \emph{hurt}, \emph{anger}, or
\emph{resentment}, but underneath lies a measurable discrepancy
$e(t)$ between expected and observed outcomes.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{prediction_error.pdf}
  \caption{Social prediction error: promised outcome vs.\ actual outcome.}
\end{figure}

Control theory offers a tidy lens: rising error triggers a corrective
impulse—an urge to confront, to seek apology, or to withdraw trust.
The larger or more frequent the error, the stronger the impulse.
Section~\ref{sec:reach} shows how a structured correction cycle
(Worthington’s REACH model) can drive $e(t)\rightarrow 0$ and
restore equilibrium we call \emph{forgiveness}.



\section*{2.2  Worthington’s REACH Cycle}
\label{sec:reach}

In relationships big and small, hurt breeds error signals that linger until someone steps in to repair them.  
Robert Enright and Everett Worthington crystallized centuries of wisdom into the REACH model, a five-stage loop for restoring trust:

\begin{description}[noitemsep]
  \item[\textbf{R}ecall]  Pause long enough to name the wound.  
  \item[\textbf{E}mpathize]  See the pain through the other’s eyes.  
  \item[\textbf{A}ltruistic Gift]  Offer kindness without expectation.  
  \item[\textbf{C}ommit]  Pledge to change or make amends.  
  \item[\textbf{H}old]  Maintain forgiveness even if setbacks occur.  
\end{description}

Viewed through control theory, each step feeds back on the emotional error $e(t)$:  
we recall the mismatch between promise and reality, infuse it with empathy (damping the negative spike),  
send an altruistic gift (a corrective impulse), commit to a new baseline, and hold that baseline against future error.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{reach_loop.pdf}
  \caption{REACH modeled as a closed‐loop error‐correction process.}
\end{figure}

\section*{2.3  From Personal to Collective Repair}

Just as software teams run patch cycles—triage bugs, push fixes, and rerun tests—the REACH loop scales  
from individuals to institutions.  A workplace apology email followed by concrete policy change is a corporate-level REACH cycle;  
a town hall that listens to grievances and enacts new ordinances is a civic REACH loop.  
In both cases, the same five‐stage structure guides error $e(t)\to0$ and steers the system back into equilibrium.

\section*{2.4  Biological Echo}

Neuroimaging reveals the brain’s own REACH-like signals:  
as participants move from recall to empathy, amygdala activation drops and prefrontal control ramps up \cite{Worthington2006_REACH}.  
That shift mirrors the formal loop above—proof that our circuits, like our code, can learn to self-repair.

\section*{2.5  Lay Takeaway}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Naming your hurt is the first step toward healing.  
  \item Empathy and generosity are not soft—they are precise correction tools.  
  \item Commitment plus patience locks in repair even when setbacks threaten.  
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent Next: We’ll see how multiple REACH loops collide and coexist—that’s where justice and mercy become a shared constraint problem.



\chapter{Justice and Mercy as Constraint Satisfaction}

\section*{3.1  Two Sliders, One Panel}
Justice reaches for proportional response—“an eye for an eye”—while mercy leans toward repair without excess loss.  Imagine two sliders side by side on a control panel.  Push Justice too far, and the system grows harsh; push Mercy too far, and harmful patterns can revive.  A \emph{true balance} holds both sliders above a living threshold: enough deterrence to signal “this cannot stand,” and enough restoration to say “you may yet return.”  
Before we map that balance, let’s see how real societies have set their defaults.

\section*{3.2  Three Historical Snapshots}
\textit{How cultures have weighted justice and mercy at different times:}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item \textbf{Hammurabi’s Code} (c.\ 1750 BCE)  
    \; Justice maxed—“If a man strikes another, his hand is cut off”—mercy nearly zero.  
  \item \textbf{Rawls’ Difference Principle} (1971)  
    \; Advocates raising the welfare of the least-advantaged (mercy up-arrow) while maintaining fair opportunity (justice approx-equals mid).
  \item \textbf{South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission} (1995)  
    \; Mercy high—full amnesty for truthful confession—balanced by public accountability (justice > 0).  
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{justice_mercy_graph.pdf}
  \caption{Justice–Mercy slider settings across three cultures.}
\end{figure}

\section*{3.3  Contemporary Settings}
Modern systems sit between these poles:
\begin{description}[noitemsep]
  \item[\textbf{Criminal courts}]  
    High justice threshold—punishment as deterrent—with limited mercy through parole or restorative panels.
  \item[\textbf{Restorative circles}]  
    Justice threshold lowered—focus on victim’s needs—mercy raised via community support and mutual agreement.
  \item[\textbf{Momentum-badge lattice}]  
    Micro-errors self-correct automatically: small slips downgrade your badge (justice), but completing low-risk “make-good” tasks restores it (mercy), all without formal process.
\end{description}

These examples show that no single setting is “right.”  The “best” balance emerges when justice and mercy are tuned to the context—when communities choose the sliders, not let them drift by default.

\bigskip
\noindent\textbf{—Next:}  
In Section 3.4 we’ll see how software constraint solvers navigate similar trade-offs—without equations in the main text—before revisiting the neurobiology of mercy in Section 3.5.


\section*{5.4  A Solver Without Equations}
Software engineers use \emph{constraint solvers}: tools that adjust many dials until all requirements can live together.
When the solver finds no exact fit, it can soften some dials—reducing the weight of a less-critical requirement—so the system keeps working rather than stalling.  
We treat Mercy as that softening dial: enough give to keep the whole mechanism moving.
(Readers who want the formal optimisation see Appendix A.)

\section*{5.5  Biological Echo}
Neuro-imaging links striatal action-cost coding to proportional punishment\cite{Buckholtz2015_NeuroJustice},
while anterior insula activity that signals unfairness drops after a sincere apology—Mercy in neural form\cite{Yu2014_NeuroMercy}.

\section*{5.6  Bridge to Identity}
Which dials we even notice depends on who we think we are and who we think the other is.
Next we explore projection and discrimination loops that bend the panel before balancing begins.



\chapter{Identity, Projection, and Discrimination}

\section*{4.0  Parable Opener (TBD)}
% — insert your chosen dialog or vignette here —

\section*{4.1  Projection: Seeing Self in Other}

We all carry parts of ourselves we’d rather not admit.  Carl Jung called this the “shadow”—traits we repress and then, unconsciously, attribute to others.  In one classic study, participants shown blurred faces of in‐group versus out‐group members activated distinct areas of the medial prefrontal cortex when making judgments\cite{Amodio2014_SocialBrain}.  Projection is that first misstep: we see in others the very faults we refuse to face in ourselves.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{projection_loop.pdf}
  \caption{Projection loop: repressed trait → perceived in other → defensive response → further repression.}
\end{figure}

\section*{4.2  Feedback Gone Tilted}

Left unchecked, projection becomes a self-reinforcing loop:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item You misread another’s neutral gesture as hostile.
  \item Your defensive reaction provokes genuine tension.
  \item The tension “confirms” your suspicion.
  \item You reinforce the original projection.
\end{enumerate}

A small dose of **self-reflection**—pausing to ask “Could this be me?”—acts as a damper, breaking the spiral before it escalates.

\section*{4.3  Stereotype Threat \& Performance Error}

Steele \& Aronson (1995) demonstrated that simply telling test-takers that “this exam measures innate ability” triggered worse performance among negatively stereotyped groups\cite{Steele1995_Stereotype,Spencer1999_Math}.  Within minutes, cortisol levels rise and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex must work overtime to suppress anxiety, shrinking the brain’s “attractor basins” and raising error rates\cite{Townsend2010_Cortisol,Krendl2008_fMRIThreat}.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{stereotype_noise.pdf}
  \caption{Threat-induced noise reduces basin size in a Hopfield-style landscape, increasing mistakes.}
\end{figure}

Critically, when the threat cue is removed—or reframed as “a puzzle for fun”—performance rebounds to baseline, proving the effect is social, not innate.

\section*{4.4  Proxy Masks and Decision Rights}

One way to block early bias is a **proxy mask**: an AI intermediary that strips identifying metadata (accent, age, gender) leaving only task-relevant facts.  Decisions are made on a sanitized transcript, then re-linked to the individual only after role-specific clearance.

\[
  \underbrace{\text{Raw Input (voice, pronouns, accent)}}_{\text{masked}}
  \;\longrightarrow\;
  \underbrace{\text{Structured Task Data}}_{\text{visible to agent}}
  \;\longrightarrow\;
  \underbrace{\text{Outcome + Feedback}}_{\text{delivered back}}
\]

This preserves empathy where it’s needed—after task assignment—while preventing split-second “gut” biases from skewing critical first impressions.

\section*{4.5  Biological Echo}

The fusiform face area distinguishes familiar from unfamiliar faces in under 200 ms\cite{Golby2001_Fusiform}, and amygdala reactivity to out-group faces can halve after brief individuation training\cite{Lebrecht2012_AmygdalaBias}.  These findings mirror our proxy-mask design: by delaying identity cues until after engagement, we let the brain’s rapid-fire categorizations cool before final decisions are made.

\section*{4.6  Bridge to Tier III}

With projection damped and stereotype loops broken, our repair bandwidth rises.  In the next Part, we’ll see how educated populations can harness that bandwidth to rebuild fragile systems—and eventually upgrade entire cultural runtimes.



\part{Tier III – Systemic Synthesis}

\chapter{Rebuild vs.\ Repair: The Load/Bandwidth Heuristic}

\section*{5.1  Two Modes of Fixing}
When something breaks, we have two choices:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \textbf{Repair:} Patch the damage, restore the original structure.  
  \item \textbf{Rebuild:} Tear down and construct anew.  
\end{itemize}
Repair is often faster, but can accumulate technical debt (or social resentment).  
Rebuild guarantees a fresh start, but at far greater cost and risk.

\section*{5.2  The Load/Bandwidth Ratio}
We model a system’s health by comparing:
\[
\text{Fault load } L = \sum_i (\text{frequency}_i \times \text{severity}_i),
\quad
\text{Repair bandwidth } B = N_{\text{agents}} \times C_{\text{capacity}},
\]
where $C_{\text{capacity}}$ is the average spare cognitive or operational capacity per agent.  
\[
\text{If } \frac{L}{B} \le 1,\text{ repair suffices; if } \frac{L}{B} \gg 1,\text{ rebuild is wiser.}
\]

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{load_bandwidth_graph.pdf}
  \caption{When load exceeds bandwidth, repeated repairs grind the system to a halt; rebuilding resets capacity.}
\end{figure}

\section*{5.3  Examples in Practice}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \textbf{Software patches:}  
    A codebase with ten high-severity bugs per release can handle weekly patches (repair).  
    When that rate triples, the team often spins up a rewrite project (rebuild).  
  \item \textbf{Urban infrastructure:}  
    Filling potholes in a street works while cracks are few.  
    When the network crumbles across miles, repaving (rebuild) becomes more cost-effective.  
  \item \textbf{Cultural norms:}  
    Minor policy violations in a community can be mediated one-off.  
    When distrust is systemic, a new charter or governance overhaul (rebuild) may restore trust faster than endless mediations.  
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent\textbf{—Next:}  
In Section 5.4 we’ll see how transitional scaffolds can buy bandwidth, letting repair stay viable longer.



\section*{5.4  Transitional Scaffolds}

Sometimes the load outpaces our repair bandwidth, but we can install lightweight scaffolds that hold the system together while people learn:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \textbf{Momentum badges:}  
    A simple three-color badge (Green/Yellow/Red) tracks short-term reliability, 
    letting small slips self-heal through micro-tasks without formal sanction.
  \item \textbf{Proxy masks:}  
    AI intermediaries strip away identity cues on first contact, preventing split‐second bias 
    until participants reconvene with full context.
  \item \textbf{Error-redirection queues:}  
    Minor conflicts reroute into anonymous forums for mediation, keeping front‐line work moving 
    while deeper dialogue happens in parallel.
\end{itemize}

These scaffolds are not meant to be permanent rules but **planned obsolescence**:  
as education raises repair bandwidth, each support can be safely removed without collapse.



\chapter{Designing Transitional Scaffolds}

\section*{6.1  Why Scaffolds Matter}
When repair bandwidth is still growing, even small errors can cascade.  
Transitional scaffolds are temporary supports—lightweight rules or tools—that buy time and space for deeper learning.  
They hold the system together long enough for education and self-reflection to raise repair capacity, then gracefully retire.

\section*{6.2  Momentum Badges: Tiny Reliability Signals}
Imagine volunteers wearing three-color badges:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \textbf{Green}: consistently on time and accurate.  
  \item \textbf{Yellow}: minor slips—needs a quick “make-good” task.  
  \item \textbf{Red}: repeated errors—pair with a mentor.  
\end{itemize}
Badges update in real time. Because slips self-correct via micro-tasks, formal complaints never need to arise.  As everyone masters the loops, badge maintenance fades into the background.

\section*{6.3  Proxy Masks: Sanitizing First Impressions}
First contacts carry bias: accent, gender, age.  A proxy mask strips away all but task-relevant data.  
\[
\underbrace{\text{Raw Input (voice, pronouns, accent)}}_{\text{hidden}}
\;\longrightarrow\;
\underbrace{\text{Structured Task Data}}_{\text{shown}}
\;\longrightarrow\;
\underbrace{\text{Final Outcome}}_{\text{linked back}}
\]
Agents see only the middle.  After tasks complete, full identities reconnect—but only once trust is established.  Early bias is paused until the loop of experience can resume safely.

\section*{6.4  Error-Redirection Queues: Parallel Repair Channels}
Not every mistake needs immediate spotlight.  Small conflicts auto-route into anonymous forums where peers can suggest fixes without naming names.  Front-line work continues uninterrupted, and deeper dialogue happens in parallel.  When parties are ready, summaries guide them back into a private, mediated repair loop.

\section*{6.5  Planned Obsolescence of Scaffolds}
Scaffolds are by design time-limited:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item \emph{Activate}: when $L/B>1$ (load exceeds bandwidth).  
  \item \emph{Observe}: track how $B$ grows as people learn.  
  \item \emph{Retire}: when $L/B\le1$, remove the scaffold and let the pure loops stand alone.  
\end{enumerate}
Documentation and dashboards make it clear: “This support ends on June 2026 or when reliability hits 95\%—whichever comes first.”

\section*{6.6  Biological Echo}
Just as the developing prefrontal cortex relies on adult scaffolding until it matures,  
early learners depend on external cues until their internal loops strengthen.  
Neuroscience shows that repeated, low-stakes feedback enhances synaptic consolidation in the dorsolateral prefrontal network \cite{BenYakov2015_SynapticScaffold}.  

\section*{6.7  Bridge to Cultural Runtime}
With personal and small-group scaffolds removed, culture-wide repair loops can run at full speed.  
Next we will explore how an entire society can upgrade its “runtime” to embed recursive ethics in law, education, and technology.

\chapter{Control-Theory Derivation of the REACH Loop}

Recall the PI-style update from §2.2:
\[
\dot{F}(t) = -k\,e(t).
\]
Here we derive how the sequence of Recall–Empathize–Altruistic gift–Commit–Hold
steps implements a sampled-data approximation of this continuous law,
and prove that under mild gains $k>0$, the error $e(t)\to0$ exponentially.

\chapter{Load–Bandwidth Ratio: Formal Analysis}
\label{app:loadband}

We defined
\[
L = \sum_i \bigl(f_i \times s_i\bigr),\quad
B = N\cdot C,
\]
and argued repair suffices when $L/B\le1$. Here we:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Derive bounds on the expected time-to-failure under repeated repair cycles.
  \item Show that when $L/B>1$, the expected number of outstanding faults grows unbounded.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Hopfield Network Energy Function}
\label{app:hopfield}

This appendix gives the standard Hopfield energy
\[
E(x) = -\tfrac12\,x^\top W x + \theta^\top x
\]
and shows that each asynchronous update reduces $E$, proving
convergence to a (local) minimum.

  \item How one constructs a Boolean circuit from any Turing machine (and vice versa).
